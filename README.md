# World_Weather_Analysis

## Summary
The goal of this project was to create a program that creates an itinerary for a vacation using weather factors to decide on possible destinations, and creates a set of directions on a map for the user to plan their trip. This was done using the OpenWeather and Google Maps APIs.

## Difficulties
One of the biggest problems that I ran into was the fact that in order to make sure that the maps work correctly you can not use jupyter lab. This should work correctly in both jupyter notebook and VS Code. 

## Results
This program results in an interactive map that the user can look at weather conditions in the cities of their choosing and can also find directions between these cities.
